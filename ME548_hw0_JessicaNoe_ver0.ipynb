        "> I worked in manufacturing for 10 years and discovered engineers have the most interesting problems to solve. I came to UW in 2014 to complete my bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering. I was on the competition underwater robotics team and graduated from the ME dept with an emphasis in mechatronics and minor in oceanography.\n",
        "\n",
        "> I have been with the UW ME department's Marine Renewable Energy Lab since 2016. I was a UW staff engineer for the lab during a gap year between graduating in June 2017 and beginning the ME master's program in Fall 2018. I build instruments for oceanographic measurements.\n",

        "b. What do you hope to do after you graduate?\n",
        "\n",

        "c. Why did you enroll in this course?\n",
        "\n",
        "> I would like to continue building my understanding of control theory. Controlling a robot or instrument to move it through the ocean can sometimes require a more complex control system than a simple PID controller. Multivariable control sounded useful.\n",

        "> I have used Matlab for my engingeering and math coursework. It is also the preferred tool in my lab, so I have done some analysis and figure generation in Matlab. I have used Python in oceanography and data-science coursework. Fall 2018 I was able to take an introduction to Python for data analysis and became more familiar with Python and Github.\n",
